PREPARE

Before running, you need to ensure that one or more of specjbb, speccpu, and specpower have been installed.

For each workload, you need to write the adjusted parameters into a script. The results generated by this script should be in the 
subdirectory 'result' under the same level directory(Specifically, the specpower result file is 'Results').
For specjbb, this script should be named 'run_specjbb.sh'
For specpower, this script should be named 'run_specpower.sh'
Note that we divide the speccpu into SIR(specint) and SFR(specfloat)
So for speccpu, this script should be named 'run_speccpu_int.sh' and 'run_speccpu_fp.sh'. In particular, we need to pass iteration parameters into the script that executes speccpu.

To ensure the normal use of the tool, it is recommended to dry run each workload separately before use
(In particular, speccpu will compile)

You also need to install some third-party python 3 libraries use the following command:
$pip3 install lxml
$pip3 install xlwt

QUICK START

1.Modify config file -- sweep.config
We use ',' to separate multiple configurations, and '-' to represent the range
#example:uncore_ceiling(Ghz) = 2.0, 2.2-2.5
#The example represents 2.0Ghz, 2.2Ghz, 2.3Ghz, 2.4Ghz, 2.5Ghz. Range [0.8, 2.5], step 0.1 Ghz

2.Enter the command to view the tool usage:
$ ./main.sh â€“h
Use the command '$./main.sh' 
Follow the prompts on the screen to get a result.xls file in the output path, which is the final result
